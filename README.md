# Direct chat with React and Node

## Purpose
Create a bridge connection state between users while also keeping the state for less data trafic usage.

## Notes
- The images are being stored in the local DB rather than a CDN for obvious reasons (later for deployment it should be changed)
- The project is using Material UI and React-Spring
